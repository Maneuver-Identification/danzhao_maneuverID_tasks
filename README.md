The Task_1 folder contains files/scripts relevant for Task 1 of the challenge and the Task_2 folder contains files/scripts for Task 2.

For Task_1, a jupyter notebook is provided that illustrates the model/data pre-processing steps taken to train a modified ResNet to distinguish between
good and bad tracks. The model weights are also saved as a compressed file for ease of inference. The directory variable "root_dir" in the notebook will require changing to reflect a user's personal directory path structure.


Task_2: Due to the high volume of data and computation required for this approach to task 2, you will likely not be able to run it on a personal computer (it will take too long) unless you have a personal GPU.
